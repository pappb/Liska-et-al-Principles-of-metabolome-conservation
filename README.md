<h1 align="center">Modeling supplementary material for Liska et al. manuscript "Principles of metabolome conservation in animals".</h1>

This repository contains the simulation results, extra-analysis scripts and the modeling framework from Liska et al. manuscript "Principles of metabolome conservation in animals".
- `DataS2` contains the dataset and scripts for the calculation of the effect of biological replicates noise on the estimation of metabolic abundance evolution rates;
- `DataS3` contains all the simulation results;
- `ScriptS1` contains the modeling framework;
- `ScriptS2` contains extra-analysis and figure generation scripts.

Additional README files are availables in sub-folders.

The modeling framework with a full documentation and installation instructions are primarily available here: https://github.com/charlesrocabert/MetEvolSim/ (also as a Python package: https://pypi.org/project/MetEvolSim/).

Do not hesitate to contact the authors if you plan to use the modeling framework.
