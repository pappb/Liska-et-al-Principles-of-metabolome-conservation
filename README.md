This repository contains the simulation results, extra-analysis scripts and the modelling framework from Liska et al. manuscript "Principles of metabolome conservation in animals".
- `DataS2` contains the dataset and scripts for the calculation of the effect of biological replicates noise on the estimation of metabolic abundance evolution rates;
- `DataS3` contains all the simulation results;
- `ScriptS1` contains the modelling framework;
- `ScriptS2` contains extra-analysis and figure generation scripts.

Additional README files are available in the sub-folders.

The modelling framework with a full documentation and installation instructions is primarily available here: https://github.com/charlesrocabert/MetEvolSim/.

Do not hesitate to contact the authors if you plan to use the modelling framework for research purpose.
